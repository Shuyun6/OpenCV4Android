#### This file records how I build this project and the purpose of what I want to do via OpenCV inAndroid ####
## I have build this project in several months ago, it build with openCVLibrary340 and I had converted a RGB bitmap to gray, but no other progresses
## so, today I want to build it again with the latest library and record every steps, cuz I have bought a OpenCV book for learning systematically
##
## For that, I don't know how to write a record file by a correct format, so I just use a simple words to record it
## 2018-11-09 17:07
## Purpose:
## 1. Included the latest library from OpenCV
## 2. Build the project successfully
## 3. Process a bitmap by OpenCV library
## 4. Process a bitmap in JNI
## 5. Process raw data in camera api
## end

Step:
1. Download OpenCV SDK in https://opencv.org/releases.html , version 3.4.3 (2018-11-09)
2. Clear the project's old file(because I have built it before, and now I have forgot a lot of details about it. So I need to restart like this is a new project and record the steps)
3. a:
    If you just want to use it in NDK, just add the following codes to CMakeLists
        set( OpenCV_DIR F:/OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/jni )
        find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED)

   Like the CMake file in sdk/jni suggested, and references my project's CMake file

   b:
    If you want to use it in java code without a external manager.apk, just import the openCVLibrary and java3.so(found in sdk/libs)
